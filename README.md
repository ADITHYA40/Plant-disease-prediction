# Plant-disease-prediction
This project is a Plant Disease Detection System built using Deep Learning and Flask. It allows users to upload plant leaf images and receive predictions about potential diseases. The system is powered by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the PlantVillage dataset, providing high accuracy in identifying multiple crop diseases.
